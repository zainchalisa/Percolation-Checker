# Percolation-Checker

This is a Java program designed to check if there is a continuous path of blocks from the top of the image to the bottom. Using arrays and the Std library, I created a program that would return a boolean value depending on the randomly generated image.

The weighted quick union find file was provided to me for this project. I completed the methods openSite, percolationCheck, and openAllSites in the percolation.java file for this project.

To run this program you will need the StdIn and StdOut libraries on your computer. With the other files in the repository you should be able to run to the program and see how it works.
